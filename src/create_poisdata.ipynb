       "  '\"Editing of article without Consensus & Removal of Cited Content without Discussion===\\nI find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there\\'s no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I\\'ll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not \"\"patent nonsense\"\", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to \"\"Uncertain\"\". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don\\'t know about an author, here\\'s a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What\\'s more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. \\n\\nLet me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I\\'ve said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.   \\n\\n===\"'],\n",
